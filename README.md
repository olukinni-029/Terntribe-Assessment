#### A Short-writeup on my approach and decision on the assessment
My approach to this assessment began by considering the choice of database, as it influences how data is stored and retrieved. I also considered the potential for scaling the application, ensuring that all concerns were properly separated. I selected PostgreSQL as the database and used Sequelize ORM to facilitate easy data mapping. I established the connection and defined the schema for Causes and Contributions in line with the ORM. Following this, I imported the necessary package dependencies, including express, dotenv, pg, pg-hstore, sequelize, sequelize-cli, and multer. To handle file uploads, I implemented middleware for image file processing.
